We show how this stochastic process can be used as a prior distribution in a nonparametric Bayesian model of document collections. Specifically, we present an application to information retrieval in which documents are modeled as paths down a random tree, and the preferential attachment dynamics of the nCRP leads to clustering of documents according to sharing of topics at multiple levels of abstraction. Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm finds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree. We demonstrate this algorithm on several collections of scientific abstracts. This model exemplifies a recent trend in statistical machine learning-the use of nonparametric Bayesian methods to infer distributions on flexible data structures.},

Individual features or wavelet coefficients are marginally described by Dirichlet process (DP) mixtures, yielding the heavy-tailed marginal distributions characteristic of natural images. Dependencies between features are then captured with a hidden Markov tree, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods used to learn models whose latent state space grows in complexity as more images are observed. By truncating the potentially infinite set of hidden states, we are able to exploit efficient belief propagation methods when learning these hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov trees (HDP-HMTs) from data. We show that our generative models capture interesting qualitative structure in natural scenes, and more accurately categorize novel images than models which ignore spatial relationships among features.},

We propose a novel solution to this problem, which regularizes a statistical topic model with a harmonic regularizer based on a graph structure in the data. The proposed method bridges topic modeling and social network analysis, which leverages the power of both statistical topic models and discrete regularization. The output of this model well summarizes topics in text, maps a topic on the network, and discovers topical communities. With concrete selection of a topic model and a graph-based regularizer, our model can be applied to text mining problems such as author-topic analysis, community discovery, and spatial text mining. Empirical experiments on two different genres of data show that our approach is effective, which improves text-oriented methods as well as network-oriented methods. The proposed model is general; it can be applied to any text collections with a mixture of topics and an associated network structure.},

The extracted "universal" topics have multiple types of representations, with each type corresponding to one language. Accordingly, new documents of different languages can be represented in a space using a group of universal topics, which makes various multilingual Web applications feasible.},

Furthermore, SAM can model word absence/presence at the document level, and unlike previous models can assign explicit negative weight to topic terms. Performance is evaluated empirically, both through human ratings of topic quality and through diverse classification tasks from natural language processing and computer vision. In these experiments, SAM consistently outperforms existing models.},

The cDTM is a dynamic topic model that uses Brownian motion to model the latent topics through a sequential collection of documents, where a "topic" is a pattern of word use that we expect to evolve over the course of the collection. We derive an efficient variational approximate inference algorithm that takes advantage of the sparsity of observations in text, a property that lets us easily handle many time points. In contrast to the cDTM, the original discrete-time dynamic topic model (dDTM) requires that time be discretized. Moreover, the complexity of variational inference for the dDTM grows quickly as time granularity increases, a drawback which limits fine-grained discretization. We demonstrate the cDTM on two news corpora, reporting both predictive perplexity and the novel task of time stamp prediction.},

  abstract = {Latent Dirichlet Allocation models a document by a mixture of topics, where each topic itself is typically modeled by a unigram word distribution. Documents however often have known structures, and the same topic can exhibit different word distributions under different parts of the structure. We extend latent Dirichlet allocation model by replacing the unigram word distributions with a factored representation conditioned on both the topic and the structure. In the resultant model each topic is equivalent to a set of unigrams, reflecting the structure a word is in. The proposed model is more flexible in modeling the corpus. The factored representation prevents combinatorial explosion and leads to efficient parameterization. We derive the variational optimization algorithm for the new model. The model shows improved perplexity on text and image data, but no significant accuracy improvement when used for classification.},
