Here is a Bibtex file with many interesting papers
on Latent Dirichlet Allocation and other literature on topic models.


Thanks to David Mimno for the original idea:

COMMUNITY TODO:
  - submit pull requests if you have a good LDA .bib file 
    (you can just add a new file and I will merge them).



PERSONAL TODO:
  - change from "note" field (always displayed) to a
    summary field
  - create a custom bib-style which shows the summary
    field below (or in the margin?)
